# brisk

Freeze and thaw with [Nippy](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy) at the command line.

# Install

Download the latest from the [releases page](https://github.com/justone/brisk/releases).

# Usage

Freeze data:

```
brisk --freeze -i data.edn -o data.nippy
```

Thaw data:

```
brisk --thaw -i data.nippy -o data.edn
```

If input or output is not specified, stdin or stdout will be used:

```
cat data.edn | brisk -f | brisk -t > data2.edn
```

## Encryption

Brisk supports reading and writing [encrypted Nippy data](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy#encryption-v2).
See [these docs](http://ptaoussanis.github.io/nippy/taoensso.nippy.html#var-aes128-encryptor)
for details about the difference between cached and salted passwords.

Freeze and thaw data (encrypted):

```
brisk --freeze --salted-password supersecret -i data.edn -o data.nippy
brisk --thaw --salted-password supersecret -i data.nippy -o data.edn
```

See `brisk --help` for more options, including passing the password with
environment variables.

# [Babashka pod](https://github.com/babashka/babashka.pods) support

There are four functions exposed via the pod interface:

* `(freeze-to-file filename data)` - freeze data to file, returns the number of bytes written
* `(freeze-to-file filename data opts)` - freeze data to file, returns the number of bytes written, with options
* `(thaw-from-file filename)` - returns data thawed from the file
* `(thaw-from-file filename opts)` - returns data thawed from the file, with options

* `(freeze-to-string data)` - returns frozen data as an encoded string
* `(thaw-from-string encoded)` - returns data thawed from the encoded string

Example:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bb

(require '[babashka.pods :as pods])
(pods/load-pod "brisk")
(require '[pod.brisk :as brisk])

(brisk/freeze-to-file "pod.nippy" {:han :solo})
(prn (brisk/thaw-from-file "pod.nippy"))

(brisk/freeze-to-file "pod.nippy" {:han :solo} {:password [:cached "my-password"]})
(prn (brisk/thaw-from-file "pod.nippy" {:password [:cached "my-password"]}))
```

# Development

Not quite ready yet. This depends on a soon-to-be-released library.

# Things that don't work

* Embedded objects - Nippy can handle them, but Graal VM does not support them.
